# liquidity-guard
🛡️**LiquidityGuard** is a next‑generation DeFi insurance layer designed to protect users, protocols, and institutional capital from _unintended capital loss_ caused by liquidity crises, oracle glitches, and short‑term depeg events.

## **🚨 The Problem**
DeFi has matured — yields are real, TVL is massive, and stablecoins dominate the ecosystem. Yet the biggest risks are no longer smart‑contract bugs; they are **systemic and invisible**
- Liquidity pools drain within minutes, trapping capital (as with Falcon USDf)    
- Oracles misreport, causing unfair liquidations    
- Stablecoins briefly lose peg but recover — yet users are liquidated or suffer impermanent loss before that
Existing insurance protocols (Nexus Mutual, InsurAce, Sherlock) cover **hacks and code exploits**, not **economic anomalies**. In 2025, liquidity and oracle faults have become the new black swans.

## **👤 Who It’s For**
|**DeFi Yield Farmers**|Want to farm stable yields safely without sudden lockups|Coverage auto‑pays if exit cost > threshold|

|**Institutions & DAOs**|Allocate 6–8‑figure positions into DeFi pools|Capital protection & audit‑grade transparency|

|**DeFi Protocols (Aave, Pendle, Curve)**|Want user confidence & stickier TVL|Integrate LiquidityGuard as “opt‑in protection” button|

|**Stablecoin Issuers**|Need market‑trust layer|Co‑sponsor insurance pool to prove resilience|

|**AA Wallet Users**|Expect plug‑and‑play safety|Add protection via hook or paymaster automatically|
