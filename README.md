# liquidity-guard
🛡️**LiquidityGuard** is a next‑generation DeFi insurance layer designed to protect users, protocols, and institutional capital from _unintended capital loss_ caused by liquidity crises, oracle glitches, and short‑term depeg events.

## **🚨 The Problem**
DeFi has matured — yields are real, TVL is massive, and stablecoins dominate the ecosystem. Yet the biggest risks are no longer smart‑contract bugs; they are **systemic and invisible**
- Liquidity pools drain within minutes, trapping capital (as with Falcon USDf)    
- Oracles misreport, causing unfair liquidations    
- Stablecoins briefly lose peg but recover — yet users are liquidated or suffer impermanent loss before that
Existing insurance protocols (Nexus Mutual, InsurAce, Sherlock) cover **hacks and code exploits**, not **economic anomalies**. In 2025, liquidity and oracle faults have become the new black swans.

## **👤 Who It’s For**
|**DeFi Yield Farmers**|Want to farm stable yields safely without sudden lockups|Coverage auto‑pays if exit cost > threshold|

|**Institutions & DAOs**|Allocate 6–8‑figure positions into DeFi pools|Capital protection & audit‑grade transparency|

|**DeFi Protocols (Aave, Pendle, Curve)**|Want user confidence & stickier TVL|Integrate LiquidityGuard as “opt‑in protection” button|

|**Stablecoin Issuers**|Need market‑trust layer|Co‑sponsor insurance pool to prove resilience|

|**AA Wallet Users**|Expect plug‑and‑play safety|Add protection via hook or paymaster automatically|

## **⚙️ Core Design Pillars**

1. **Parametric Coverage** — triggers based on objective on‑chain data, not governance votes.
    
2. **Instant Payouts** — deterministic, verifiable, and bounded.
    
3. **Liquidity‑Aware Models** — coverage driven by real pool metrics (reserves, depth, swap quotes).
    
4. **Composability** — EVM contracts + off‑chain attestation infra.
    
5. **Transparency** — full data traceability; open Grafana dashboards.
    
## **💡 Strategic Goal**

LiquidityGuard aims to:

- Reduce DeFi’s systemic fragility.
    
- Enable institutional on‑chain participation with verifiable protection.
    
- Create a standardized data layer for liquidity risk pricing.

## **🎯 Objectives & Success Criteria (MVP)**

- **Demonstrate automatic parametric payout** on a reproduced USDf event (mainnet‑fork) for a Curve pool.
    
- **Ship a minimal partner‑ready stack**: on‑chain contracts + off‑chain Risk Engine + Attestation + Keeper + Dashboard.
    
- **Provide a plug‑and‑play integration path** for Curve (widget + SDK + API + PartnerRegistry contract).
    
- **Time‑box:** 2–3 weeks focused build (solo dev feasible).
